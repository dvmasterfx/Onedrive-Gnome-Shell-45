# OneDrive GNOME Shell Extension

This is a GNOME Shell extension I use as frontend for the unofficial abraunegg OneDrive client (https://github.com/abraunegg/onedrive) on my desktop.
This extension was created by Diego Bazzanella and modified by me to update it and add something new.
This extension is forked from diegstroyer https://github.com/diegstroyer/oneDrive

# Features

OneDrive Gnome Shell Extension can:

- check that systemctl and onedrive are installed;
- start and stop oneddrive as user service;
- show the status of the abraunegg onedrive service;
- show the process of the abraunegg onedrive service;
- show an icon on the system tray (changing color if service is disabled, active o "in sync");
- show OneDrive local folder;
- show emblems on OneDrive local folder;
- open OneDrive web site;
- perform authentication via command line;

# Install

Install the client. Detailed instructions here: https://github.com/abraunegg/onedrive/blob/master/docs/INSTALL.md. If you have Ubuntu installed take a look at [this advise](https://github.com/abraunegg/onedrive/blob/master/docs/INSTALL.md#important-information-for-all-ubuntu-and-ubuntu-based-distribution-users).

Go to the GNOME Shell Extension page, searh for "OneDrive Client" and install it. You have to login and activate the onedrive service via the extension. That's all!
