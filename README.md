# One Drive gnome shell extension

This is a Gnome Shell extension I use as frontend for the unofficial abraunegg onedrive client (https://github.com/abraunegg/onedrive) on my desktop.
This extension was created by Diego Bazzanella and modified by me to update it and add something new.
This extension is forked from diegstroyer https://github.com/diegstroyer/oneDrive

# Features

One Drive Gnome Shell Extension can: 

- check that systemctl and onedrive are installed;
- start and stop oneddrive as user service;
- show the status of the abraunegg onedrive service;
- show the process of the abraunegg onedrive service;
- show an icon on the system tray (changing color if service is disabled, active o "in sync");
- show One Drive local folder;
- show emblems on One Drive local folder;
- open One Drive web site;
- perform authentication via command line;

# Install

Install the client. Detailed instructions here: https://github.com/abraunegg/onedrive/blob/master/docs/INSTALL.md. If you have ubuntu installed take a look to <a href="https://github.com/abraunegg/onedrive/blob/master/docs/INSTALL.md#important-information-for-all-ubuntu-and-ubuntu-based-distribution-users">this advise</a>.

Go to gnome shell extension page, searh for "OneDrive resurect" and install it. You have to make login and activate the service via extension. That's all!
